    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >√âcole Mondiale World School is committed to protect the health, safety and welfare of students who are members of our school community. Child abuse and neglect are violations of a child‚Äôs human rights and are obstacles to a child‚Äôs education as well as to their physical, emotional, and social development. We are committed to ensuring that all members of our community are aware of and held accountable to high standards of care, respect, integrity and trust and that they all understand their obligation to protect the welfare of children and report any suspicion or knowledge of child endangerment.

      The school has a Code of Conduct, a Child Protection Policy and procedures which are in accordance of the recommendations of the International Task Force on Child Protection and are consistent with our school‚Äôs mission and vision. Our Child Protection policy is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) of which India is a signatory. As an international school implementing its child protection policy, √âcole Mondiale World School will act in accordance with security. </p>

   <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Implemented Online Attendance Management System: 
This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students‚Äô absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum‚Äôs subjects. As soon as you enter a student‚Äôs Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span ‚Äì just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
